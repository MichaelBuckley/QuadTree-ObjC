Cocoa project showing how to implement a Quadtree (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree) in both Objective-C and C++.

The Objective-C version is about 2x to 3x slower than the C++ version despite using the same algorithm. Neither version is particularly optimised although the Objective-C version is doing some dumb things that could be cleaned up relatively easily.
